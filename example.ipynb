    "# LLM ChatBot Class Example\n",
    "## Author: Simon-Pierre Boucher\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, **Language Learning Models (LLMs)** have become indispensable tools for a myriad of applications, ranging from natural language understanding to advanced content generation. This Jupyter Notebook showcases the practical implementation of the `ChatBot` class, a versatile Python class designed to interact seamlessly with multiple LLM providers: **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, and **Mistral**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demonstrate Multi-Provider Interaction**: Utilize the `ChatBot` class to engage with different LLM providers, showcasing its flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "- **Execute Multiple Exchanges**: Perform three distinct conversational exchanges with each provider to illustrate response generation and handling.\n",
    "- **Compare Model Responses**: Facilitate the benchmarking and comparison of responses across various models and providers to assess their capabilities and performance.\n",
    "- **Enhance Readability with Markdown**: Display the generated responses in a formatted Markdown style for clear and organized presentation within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About the `ChatBot` Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ChatBot` class is a centralized interface that abstracts the complexities of interacting with different LLM APIs. By initializing the class with the desired provider and model, users can effortlessly send prompts and receive formatted responses. Key features include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unified Interface**: A single class to manage interactions with multiple LLM providers.\n",
    "- **Configurable Parameters**: Customize settings such as `temperature`, `max_tokens`, and `top_p` to control the creativity and length of the responses.\n",
    "- **Conversation History Management**: Maintain a coherent conversation by tracking the history of messages exchanged between the user and the assistant.\n",
    "- **Error Handling**: Robust mechanisms to manage API request failures and other potential issues gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Providers and Models Utilized\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook interacts with a comprehensive set of models from each provider, ensuring a broad spectrum of response styles and capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **OpenAI**\n",
    "- `gpt-4o`\n",
    "- `gpt-4o-mini`\n",
    "- `gpt-4-turbo`\n",
    "- `gpt-4`\n",
    "- `gpt-3.5-turbo`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Anthropic**\n",
    "- `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022`\n",
    "- `claude-3-opus-20240229`\n",
    "- `claude-3-sonnet-20240229`\n",
    "- `claude-3-haiku-20240307`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Mistral**\n",
    "- `mistral-small-latest`\n",
    "- `mistral-medium-latest`\n",
    "- `mistral-large-latest`\n",
    "- `open-mistral-7b`\n",
    "- `open-mixtral-8x7b`\n",
    "- `open-mixtral-8x22b`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure of the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup and Configuration**:\n",
    "    - **Environment Variables**: Securely load API keys from a `.env` file using the `dotenv` library.\n",
    "    - **Imports**: Import necessary libraries, including `requests`, `IPython.display`, and the custom `ChatBot` class from `llm_utils.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Defining User Inputs**:\n",
    "    - **Base Prompts**: Establish three different user inputs for each provider to initiate meaningful conversations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generating and Displaying Responses**:\n",
    "    - **ChatBot Initialization**: Initialize the `ChatBot` class for each provider and model.\n",
    "    - **Exchanges**: Send the defined user inputs to the respective models and retrieve responses.\n",
    "    - **Markdown Formatting**: Display the assistant's responses in a readable Markdown format for easy analysis.\n",
    "\n"

       "- 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n",
       "- 1/4 cup olive oil\n",
       "- 2 lemons (juice and zest of one lemon, juice of the other)\n",
       "- 4 cloves garlic, minced\n",
       "- 1 teaspoon dried oregano\n",
       "- 1 teaspoon dried thyme\n",
       "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",

       "**For the Roasted Vegetables:**\n",
       "- 2 cups mixed vegetables (e.g., carrots, bell peppers, zucchini, broccoli)\n",
       "- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n",
       "- Salt and pepper to taste\n",
       "- Optional: 1 teaspoon Italian seasoning or your favorite herbs\n",
       "\n",
       "#### Instructions:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Marinate the Chicken:**\n",
       "   - In a bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, lemon zest, minced garlic, oregano, thyme, salt, and pepper.\n",
       "   - Place the chicken breasts in a resealable plastic bag or a shallow dish and pour the marinade over them. Seal the bag or cover the dish and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes (up to 2 hours for more flavor).\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Preheat the Oven:**\n",
       "   - Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Prepare the Vegetables:**\n",
       "   - While the chicken is marinating, wash and chop your mixed vegetables into bite-sized pieces.\n",
       "   - In a large bowl, toss the vegetables with olive oil, salt, pepper, and optional Italian seasoning until evenly coated.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Roast the Vegetables:**\n",
       "   - Spread the vegetables in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until they are tender and slightly caramelized, stirring halfway through.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Cook the Chicken:**\n",
       "   - While the vegetables are roasting, heat a grill pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Remove the chicken from the marinade and discard the marinade.\n",
       "   - Cook the chicken for about 6-7 minutes on each side, or until the internal temperature reaches 165°F (75°C) and the chicken is golden brown. Alternatively, you can bake the chicken in the oven for about 20-25 minutes, depending on thickness.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Serve:**\n",
       "   - Once everything is cooked, plate the chicken alongside the roasted vegetables. You can garnish with additional lemon wedges or fresh herbs if desired.\n",
